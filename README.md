# Enhancing City Mobility with Cab Data Analytics

**Duration:** May 2024 - August 2024  
**Institution:** Illinois Institute of Technology

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting ride-hailing prices for two major service providers: Uber and Lyft. The goal was to build predictive models that estimate ride costs based on several factors, including distance, time, weather conditions, and service type. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and comprehensive data analysis, this project provides insights into dynamic pricing mechanisms and offers a tool to help users anticipate ride costs more effectively.

## Key Features

- **Techniques & Algorithms:** Implemented Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest algorithms to create robust prediction models.
- **Data Processing:** Cleaned and pre-processed large datasets, ensuring accuracy and reliability in modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identified and analyzed critical features like peak hours, weather conditions, and service tiers that influence pricing.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to identify the most effective algorithm.
- **Key Insights:** Gained valuable insights into the dynamic pricing mechanisms employed by ride-hailing companies and developed a tool to help users estimate ride costs.

## Datasets

- The project utilized ride-hailing datasets from Uber and Lyft, including information on ride prices, distances, weather conditions, and service types.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** R, Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- **Evaluation Metrics:** MAE, RMSE
